# Inferential-Statistics-Coursera

Course Projects created in Inferential Statistics Course from John Hopkins University. 

### Part 1 
In this the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials with a thousand simulation is analyzed. 
The distribution obtained is compared with Central Limit Theorem.
The following things are shown: 
1. The Sample mean compare it to theoretical mean 
2. The variance of sample and compare it to the theoretical varinace of the distribution 
3. Distribution is approximately normal


### Part 2

The aim of this report is to analyze the ToothGrowth DataSet in R. 
As per the help file of this dataset, the response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid). 
First we will load the ggplot library and get the summary of ToothGrowth Dataset.
